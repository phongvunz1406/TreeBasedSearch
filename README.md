Tree-Based Search Visualization

This project implements and visualizes classic tree-based search algorithms using Pygame. It provides an interactive way to explore how different search strategies traverse a map and find a path to the goal.

Implemented Algorithms

Depth-First Search (DFS)

Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS)

A* (A-Star Search)

Features

Pygame-based visualization for real-time pathfinding.

Step-by-step display of visited nodes and the final path.

Modular design: search algorithms, map handling, and visualization are separated.

Easily extendable to add new search strategies.

How It Works

Select a map and an algorithm in the program.

The system loads the map and executes the chosen algorithm.

Pygame visualization highlights the exploration process and final path.

Purpose

This project was developed as part of an AI search algorithms exercise, focusing on both uninformed and informed search methods. The visualization helps compare the efficiency and behavior of different algorithms in solving pathfinding problems.
